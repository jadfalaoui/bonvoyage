## About the Project

### Inspiration
Our group was inspired by a shared interest in travel and technology. We aimed to create a comprehensive tool that eases the travel planning process by providing automated suggestions for flights, hotels, and activities based on user preferences, all brought together through a seamless interface.

### What We Learned
This project was a tremendous learning opportunity for each member of our team. We gained deeper insights into Django's capabilities, RESTful API development, and the integration of external APIs for dynamic content retrieval. Collaboratively, we explored Google's generative AI technology which enhanced our understanding of machine learning applications in real-world scenarios.

### How We Built It
Our project is built on Django, utilizing its powerful features to serve RESTful endpoints that interact with a dynamic frontend. Key steps in our process included:

1. **API Integration:** We integrated Skyscanner for real-time flight and hotel data and Google’s generative AI for tailored travel activity suggestions.
2. **Django’s Framework:** Leveraged Django’s class-based views for efficient request and response handling.
3. **Frontend Dynamics:** Employed AJAX for asynchronous data updates, which improved the responsiveness of our web application.
4. **Collaborative Coding:** Used version control systems to manage contributions from team members, ensuring consistent updates and integration of features.

### Challenges Faced
- **API Limitations:** We tackled issues with API limitations and rate limiting, which required us to implement effective caching strategies.
- **Data Integration:** The integration and parsing of complex data from various sources presented a unique challenge, demanding a robust backend structure.
- **UI Responsiveness:** Achieving a responsive and user-friendly interface required iterative testing and feedback from all team members.
